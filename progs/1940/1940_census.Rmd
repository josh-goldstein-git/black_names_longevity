## Summary

Despite a large literature on race-specific first names negatively impacting life chances, the relationship between longevity and having a black name remains largely unexplored.

This notebook looks at the whether having a distinctively black first names in 1940 — as measured by a black names index (BNI) — is associated with relative lower social attainment for blacks in 1940. 

I'm working on the UC Berkeley Demography FC server. 

## Prepare data

Steps to prepare data: 

(1) Read in the full count census data

(2) Restrict Black folks 

(3) Clean names in the 1940 census (Josh's code)

(4) Merge on info on BNI (Black Name Index) on first name

## read in census and restricts to black folks 
census <- fread("/home/ipums/casey-ipums/IPUMS2019/1940/TSV/P.tsv")

## Filter to only include those who identify as black

  filter(RACE == 200)

## remove census
rm(census)

## read in BNI

### Black Name Index 

The black name index (BNI) is a summary measure of how distinctively black a first names are: 

\begin{equation}
BNI_{name} = \frac{\mathbb{P}(name|Black)}{\mathbb{P}(name|Black) + \mathbb{P}(name|White)} \cdot 100
\end{equation}


## Disadvantage in 1940

Are Blacks with high BNI already disadvantaged in 1940, with respect to income, occupation, and educational attainment?

## Nicknames

Is there any way to tell if people with names like “JESSIE” and “TOM” were given those names as children, or did they adopt these “nicknames” (vs. JESSE and THOMAS) later in life? If they did, then what we could be observing is reverse causality, whereby names are caused _by_ SES and not the other way around.

The figure below show the extent to which the nicknames are increasing with ae in the 1940 census among blacks. The plot shows nickname share for age 0-50. 

```{r, eval = F}
nick_name <- census_blacks %>% 
  filter(AGE < 50 ) %>% 
  group_by(AGE, sex) %>% 
  summarize(nick_frac = mean(nick))

nicknames <- ggplot(nick_name, aes(x = AGE, y = nick_frac, color = as.factor(sex))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 20) +
  ylim(0, .3) + 
  labs(title = "Nicknames",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Proportion") +
  ggsci::scale_colour_lancet() + 
  theme(legend.title=element_blank(), legend.position = "bottom")

ggsave(plot = nicknames, filename = "figures/nickname_propotion.png", height = 5, width = 7)
```

## Todo

(1) Why aren’t we finding much effect for women?
(2) If one controls for these aspects of names in 1940, does this explain the longevity gradient?
