# Data and Pre-Processing 

## Mortality Records 

We use public administrative records from the Social Security Administration as provided in the Berkeley Unified Numident Mortality Database (BUNMD) for this analysis. The BUNMD was constructed from the most informative parts of the Social Security Numerical Identification System (Numident). For every person with a Social Security, the Numident number—tracks date of birth, date of death (if applicable), and other background information including birthplace, race, sex, and names of parents. The Social Security Administration transferred a large number of these records to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), who publicly released the records in 2019. The BUNMD is a cleaned and harmonized version of the records publicly released by NARA [@goldstein_berkeley_2020]. Death coverage in the BUNMD is nearly complete for the window of 1988-2005. 

## Identifying Siblings 

To establish two men in the BUNMD as brothers, we identify men who share a common mother and father's first and last name. We have confidence in the accuracy of sibling matches because of the high rate of being born in the same state (90.6\%), although we did not use this as a matching criterion.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Establishing siblingship based on exact matches on parents' names. For exact matches, birthplace was not used as a matching field.}
\end{table}

We identify an additional set of siblings by allowing for some flexibility on the exact spelling of parents' first names. This allows for minor misspellings and transcription errors. For these additional siblings, we (conservatively) require birthplace to match. We use the following procedure: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify potential pairs of brother (restricted to 2) who reported the same place of birth, mother's last name, father's last name, but \textbf{different} father's first names and/or mother's first name.
    \item If both potential siblings reported the same father's first name but different mother's first names, establish as sibling pair if string distance between the two discrepant mother's first names  > 0.7 (based on the Levenshtein distance). 
    \item If both potential siblings reported the same mother's first name but different father's first names, establish as sibling pair if string distance between the two discrepant father's first names  > 0.7 (based on the Levenshtein distance). 
    \item If neither mother nor father's first name match exactly, establish as a sibling pair if both string distances between the two discrepant fathers' first names and between the two discrepant mothers' first names > 0.8 (based on the Levenshtein distance).
\end{enumerate}

\end{table}

## Name Standardization

We pre-process first names to account for nicknames or minor spelling and transcription errors. We clean first names by (i) removing any non-alpha characters, (ii) selecting the first word for compound string names, and (iii) restricting to first names great than one character in length. After cleaning the names, we standardize first names to account for nicknames (e.g., "Bill" $\rightarrow$ "William") and misspellings (e.g., "Williaam" $\rightarrow$ "William"). We construct a master name standardization dictionary by combining name standardization dictionaries from the IPUMS and ABE research teams.

## BNI

We use the Black Name Index (BNI), a summary measure of how distinctly black a first name proposed by Fryer and Levitt (2004). We use the standardized names to compute the BNI: 

\begin{equation}
BNI_{name_i} = \frac{P(name_i | Black)}{P(name_i | Black) + P(name_i | White)}
\end{equation}

To compute BNI, we use the BUNMD birth cohorts of 1895-1940 with information on race. This larger sample gives us more precise BNI estimates for first name.    

# Analyses 

## Main Model  

Table \ref{fig:baseline_models} shows our main result: brothers with blacker names die at younger ages. Models are robust across different specifications (e.g., model 2 does not include birth cohort fixed effects; model 5 does not restrict to the high mortality-coverage window of 1988-2005).

For our main analysis, we restrict to Black brothers who were born between 1915 and 1925, died between 1988 and 2005 (the BUNMD window with high death coverage), and had a standardized first name appearing 500 or more times in the BUNMD (N = 30,742).

## Exact vs. Non-Exact Siblings 

The estimated BNI gradient for the sample of siblings established by an exact match (model 1) is greater than the estimated BNI gradient for the sample of siblings established by the non-exact matches (model 2). While this may reflect incorrectly-identified sibling pairs biasing results toward population-wide estimates (i.e., our pooled OLS model coefficient), it is likely noise due to the small sample size of non-exact matches. For the combined sample, both the BNI gradient and standard error decreased slightly.

## Sensitivity Analysis: Birth Cohorts

For our main analysis, we used the BUNMD birth cohorts of 1915-1925. The plot below shows the estimated BNI gradients ($\beta_1 \pm 1.96 \times SE(\beta_1)$), where the 10 or 15-year window of birth cohorts was systematically varied. The results are robust across the birth cohort windows corresponding to the BUNMD high death coverage period.

\caption{\label{fig:bcohort_sensitivity_10} Panel A shows BNI gradients for 10-year windows. Panel B shows BNI gradient for 15-year windows.}
\end{figure}

## Sensitivity Analysis: Minimum Name Threshold 

Our analysis is sensitive to our choice of the minimum name frequency for a person to be included in the analysis. 
Name frequency is measured as the number of records in the original BUNMD used to calculate the BNI
for a given name. Figure \ref{fig:minimum_name} below shows the estimated BNI gradients ($\beta_1 \pm 1.96 \times SE(\beta_1)$), where the minimum frequency threshold for inclusion was systematically varied (1 to 3,001, increments of 100.) For our final analysis, we used a minimum frequency threshold of 500; that is, we dropped an individual from our analysis if their name was observed 500 times or fewer in the BUNMD (birth cohorts of 1895 - 1940 with non-missing race).

## BNI vs. Percentage Black

For our analysis, we used Black Name Index (BNI) as a measure the "Blackness" of first names. We could have alternatively used the percentage of name-holders as a measure of the "Blackness" of first names. Reassuringly, our results are consistent across both measures.

## BNI Gradient for Whites

Do we observe a BNI gradient for Whites? A BNI gradient for Whites may suggest that dimensions other than race are driving the BNI effect. Table \ref{fig:model_white} shows our main model applied to sample of White brothers. There is a trivial BNI gradient for Whites, suggesting the BNI gradient on the longevity of Black Americans is not driven by inferences on social class.

## BNI and Neighborhood Affluence 

Do people with Blacker names end up living in less affluent ZIP Codes? Table \ref{fig:zip} shows BNI is a predictor of the amount of Social Security Benefits dispersed in a ZIP Code; those with Blacker names are less likely to end up in an affluent ZIP Code.
